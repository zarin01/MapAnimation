Real-Time Bus Tracker

DESCRIPTION

This project represents the distance between Harvard and MIT using a bus going through town. In this project, we created the original MIT to Harvard through instructions and videos. After Were we were done we were instructed to update it to our liking, this is how I updated mine:

MY UPDATES:

  1. I changed the font from the default to Arial Narrow Bold and the color from white to black, I also made the size a little smaller so it didn't cover up too much of the screen.
  
  2. in the original it was MIT to Harvard, I decided to mess with the bus path a little bit and switched it around after I changed the button to say Harvard to MIT
  
  4. After this I went into MapBox.com to grab a new Access Token to change the original, after that, I was able to add a new style for the map. I changed it to a realistic-looking map and changed the colors of the street names.

HOW TO RUN 

To run this code you will need to add each file in GitHub to new files in whatever code editor you are using. If you don't use the same file names you will need to change the links for the files. It is better to run it with a live server. If you don't have one, you can download "Live Server" as an extension (Vs Studio). Run the HTML as a live server and it will run as needed.

WHAT TO IMPROVE:

In the future, we can add more places to go and add more information on the city or even the schools.
